# INTRODUCTION
DeepCapTail is deep learning project predicts capsid and tail proteins of phage genomes. Given a protein sequence as input, the output is the propabality of this sequence bein a capsid or tail protein for phage genome. This project is written in Python.

# SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
This project should run on all Unix platform, although it was only testing linux (I need to give the version)

# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
DeepCapTail requires the following packages:
1. Python- version 3.6 or later
2. Biopython - version or later
3. keras
# TO PREDICT CAPSID OR TAIL
1. Clone this repository
2. % cd DeepCapTail/
3. 
# HELP
% python predict_sequence.py --help
